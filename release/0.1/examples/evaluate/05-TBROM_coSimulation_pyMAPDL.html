<p>This example shows how PyTwin can be used to load and evaluate a Twin model in order to predict CFD results, in
the form of temperature field, and use them as inputs for a FEA thermal-structural analysis of T-junction which
considers the mixing of 2 different flow temperatures
The example is based on PyTwin to evaluate the Twin results and convert them in an appropriate format, and PyMAPDL to
load the FEA model, apply the temperature loads coming from the Twin and performing the thermal-structural analysis</p>
<p>NOTE :</p>
<p>To generate snapshot files at initialization time, the ROM component included in the Twin must
have its parameter “field_data_storage_period” set to 0 and “store_snapshots” set to 1.</p>
<p>To generate images files at initialization time, the ROM component included in the Twin must have
the “Embed Geometry” and “Generate Image” options enabled at export time, and its parameter “viewX_storage_period” set
to 0.</p>
<p>These parameters can be defined in the Twin Builder subsheet before Twin compilation, or exposed as Twin parameters.</p>

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real
 constant set 55 and contact element type 55 has been set up.  The
 companion pair has real constant set ID 56.  Both pairs should have
 the same behavior.
 ANSYS will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,
 resulting in asymmetric contact.

 24597 and target element 24797.
 Contact is detected due to initial settings.

 Max.  Geometric gap 5.108346823E-04 has been detected between contact
 element 24608 and target element 24805.
 *WARNING*: The geometric gap/penetration may be too large.  Increase
 pinball radius if it is a true geometric gap/penetration.  Decrease
 pinball if it is a false one.
