3D field ROM co-simulation with FEA model
-----------------------------------------

This example shows how PyTwin can be used to load and evaluate a Twin model in order to predict CFD results, in
the form of temperature field, and use them as inputs for a FEA thermal-structural analysis of T-junction which
considers the mixing of 2 different flow temperatures
The example is based on PyTwin to evaluate the Twin results and convert them in an appropriate format, and PyMAPDL to
load the FEA model, apply the temperature loads coming from the Twin and performing the thermal-structural analysis

NOTE :

To generate snapshot files at initialization time, the ROM component included in the Twin must
have its parameter "field_data_storage_period" set to 0 and "store_snapshots" set to 1.

To generate images files at initialization time, the ROM component included in the Twin must have
the "Embed Geometry" and "Generate Image" options enabled at export time, and its parameter "viewX_storage_period" set
to 0.

These parameters can be defined in the Twin Builder subsheet before Twin compilation, or exposed as Twin parameters.
