Introduction
------------

An analytics-driven, simulation-based digital twin is a connected, virtual replica of an
in-service physical asset, in the form of an integrated multi-domain system simulation, that
mirrors the life and experience of the asset. Ansys Digital Twins enable system design and
optimization as well as predictive maintenance, to optimize industrial asset management.
By implementing Ansys Digital Twins, you can improve top-line revenue, manage bottom-line
costs and both gain and retain competitive advantages.

Ansys Twin Builder and Ansys Twin Deployer are open solutions that allow engineers to create
Ansys Digital Twins, and export them in the form of deployable Runtimes.

What is PyTwin?
-----------------
PyTwin is part of the `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_ ecosystem that
lets you use Ansys Digital Twins Runtimes within a Python environment of your choice in
conjunction with other PyAnsys libraries and external Python
libraries.

PyTwin implements different modules to facilitate the consumption of Twin Runtimes. It gives access to
the core Runtime SDK as well as a higher level abstraction class offering Python interfaces that can
be used in any client code for workflow development and Twin Runtimes integrations. You can use PyTwin
to programmatically interact with, and control the execution of Twin Runtimes.

Features
--------
Some of the many features in the PyTwin package, ``pytwin``,
allow you to:

- Use the Twin Runtimes Core SDK to build your own consumption workflows based on atomic API calls, see :ref:`ref_index_api_sdk`
- Get access and use the Twin Evaluate module, providing an higher level abstraction implementation of Twin Runtimes consumption workflows for direct usage and integration, see :ref:`ref_index_api_evaluate`
- Get familiar with the PyTwin functionalities through multiple examples available, see :ref:`ref_example_gallery`

Documentation and issues
------------------------
In addition to :ref:`getting_started` and :ref:`ref_user_guide`, the PyTwin
documentation provides :ref:`ref_index_api`, :ref:`ref_example_gallery`,
and :ref:`ref_contributing` sections.

On the `PyTwin Issues <https://github.com/pyansys/pytwin/issues>`_ page, you can create
issues to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features. To reach

License
-------
PyTwin is licensed under the MIT license.

PyTwin makes no commercial claim over Ansys whatsoever. This library
extends the functionality of Ansys Twin Builder and Twin Deployer by adding
a Python interface
to the Digital Twins Runtimes SDK without changing the core behavior or license of the original
software's. The use of the interactive control of Ansys Digital Twins Runtimes through PyTwin
requires a license of Twin Deployer.
