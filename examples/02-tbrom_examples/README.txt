TBROM evaluation examples
=========================
These examples show how to use PyTwin to evaluate field results from TBROM included in a TWIN file.
Multiple workflows are demonstrated such as image and field data generation (with possible processing of data to other
Ansys tools like Fluent or Mechanical), TBROM evaluation with input field parameterization, output field visualization on CFD/FEA mesh for detailed post processing.
