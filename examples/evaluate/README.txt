Twin evaluation examples
=========================
These examples show how to use the evaluation workflow in a TWIN file.
Included are multiple workflow demonstrations such as these:

- Single evaluation of a dynamic model
- Parametric sweep analysis of a dynamic model
- Parametric response surface ROM evaluation
- Scalar dynamic ROM simulation with state saving and loading
- Field ROM evaluation and results visualization from the twin runtime and postprocessed in Ansys Fluent
- Field ROM evaluation and the transfer of results as inputs stress analysis in Ansys Mechanical
- Field ROM evaluation with inputs parameterized by both scalar and field data
