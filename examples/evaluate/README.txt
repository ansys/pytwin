Twin evaluation examples
=========================
These examples show how to use the evaluation workflow given a twin file. This includes multiple workflow demonstrations such as :

- single evaluation of dynamic model,
- parametric sweep of dynamic model,
- parametric response surface ROM evaluation,
- scalar dynamic ROM simulation with state saving and loading,
- field ROM evaluation and results visualization,
- field ROM evaluation and transfer of results as inputs for FEA calculation
